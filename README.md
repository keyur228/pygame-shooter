# Pygame Demo Game

## Overview

This game demonstrates the basic functioning of Python's library, pygame, for writing video games. The code provides all the logic for character animation, movements, projectiles, and score-keeping techniques. This game is a demo version and may not be error-free. Feel free to contact me via email if you find any issues.

## How to Play

You don't need to install a Python interpreter to play this game (though you can use it if you already have it installed). Instead, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Replit in any web browser.
2. Create a new repl with any name.
3. Open the shell and type:
    shell
    pip install pygame
    
   This will automatically download all the dependencies.
4. Copy and paste my code into the repl.
5. Upload the necessary files into the repl (a zip with all the necessary images and sounds is provided in this repository).

Please note that this game is currently just a Python file and is not yet executable or published. The above steps are required to play the game.
